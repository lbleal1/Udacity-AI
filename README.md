# Udacity-AI

It's been my pleasure and honor to be one of the Udacity Bertelsmann Scholarship Recipient - Artificial Intelligence (A.I) Track. Thus, this repository is dedicated to my study in the Phase 1(The Challenge Course) and Phase 2(Deep Learning Nanodegree) which I am claiming to get. 

The repository contains the exercises with discussions given by the course but it will also contain another folder for my own restructure of discussions and experimentations. 

## Phase 1: Challenge Course

### Lesson 3: Introduction to Neural Networks

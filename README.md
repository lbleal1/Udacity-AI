# Udacity-AI

It's been my pleasure and honor to be one of the Udacity Bertelsmann Scholarship Recipient - Artificial Intelligence (A.I) Track. Thus, this repository is dedicated to my study in the Phase 1(The Challenge Course) and Phase 2(Deep Learning Nanodegree) which I am claiming to get.

The repository contains the exercises with discussions given by the course but it will also contain another folder for my own restructure of discussions and experimentations. Also, I'll be publishing articles regarding what I've learned, ideally in each lesson below. Stay tune either at https://medium.com/@lbleal1 or https://towardsdatascience.com/@lbleal1. The earliest release would be this January. 

## Phase 1: Challenge Course
